# DAA PROJECT
#### This is a NITK 2nd Year B.Tech Minor Project. 
The dynamic connectivity problem is the following:<br/>
Maintain an undirected graph G so that edges may be inserted an deleted and connectivity queries may be answered efficiently.<br/><br/>

Goal: Support these three operations:<br/>
● link(u, v): Add in edge {u, v}. The assumption is that u and v are in separate trees.<br/>
● cut(u, v): Cut the edge {u, v}. The assumption is that the edge exists in the tree.<br/>
● are-connected(u, v): Return whether u and v are connected.<br/><br/>

The data structure developed can perform these operations time O(log n) each.
